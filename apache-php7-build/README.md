Apache PHP Build Docker image
===================================

A Docker image to build PHP 7.0.0-dev from source. 

You can start containers with this image, but as it is containing all dev packages and php source it is not recommended.

Use `yoshz/apache-php-dev:7.0` Docker image instead which only contains the binary files.
